<h3>Sequencing Rates</h3>

<p> 
Please note: Prices are provided to facilitate the planning of projects for grant applications, etc.  Also, please note that although we are trying to set our prices as low as possible for on-campus customers, this is nevertheless an expensive service.  Users of the service may be billed approximately two months after the services.  Thus, PIs must plan accordingly and set aside funds such that they are available at the time of billing.

<p>*Please note that the facility does not maintain a standing inventory of Mid Output sequencing kits due to low demand. Such projects can be subject to delays due to reagent shipment. Please notify us two weeks prior to submission of Mid Output projects to ensure that reagents are available for your run without delay. Although we may receive reagents with less lead time, please be aware that we cannot control ship or delivery dates from Illumina.

<p>
Prices are per lane and include cluster generation, sequencing run, base calls, and quality control reports.
To minimize costs for researchers, pricing per lane is based upon full occupancy of the flow cell (8 lanes) per sequencing run. As indicated on the introduction page, researchers are responsible for the costs and the preparation of libraries for sequencing.
